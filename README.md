# TypeScript

Collection of codes developed during a TypeScript course I'm doing to understand better how the language works and all its **capabilities**. TypeScript is a JavaScript superset, not a brand new language, but a complement to JavaScript.

It adds new features and advantages to JavaScript, such as types (obviously), interfaces, generics, next-gen JS features and others, making the language much easier to work with and more powerful, specially when working with teams.
